.SH NAME
minicoredumper.cfg.json \- the main configuration file for
.BR minicoredumper (1)
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B minicoredumper.cfg.json
is the main configuration file for
.BR minicoredumper (1).
It serves 2 purposes:
.RS
.IP 1. 3
define where dumped files should be located
.IP 2. 3
specify various
.BR minicoredumper (1)
recepts for various conditions
.RE
.
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
The file uses the JSON format. The options are:
.TP
.B base_dir
(string) The root directory where the dumped data will be stored.
The dump files will be stored in a sub-directory using the template:
.br
<command_basename>.<timestamp>.<pid>
.TP
.B watch
(array) A set of conditions, where each condition can specify its own
recept file. See
.B CONDITIONS
for configuration options for a condition.
.
.SH CONDITIONS
A condition can contain any combination of these options:
.TP
.B exe
(string) The full path to the binary being executed as returned by
.BR readlink (2).
.TP
.B comm
(string) The basename of the command that was run
(the 7th argument of the
.BR minicoredumper (1)
call).
.TP
.B recept
(string) The full path to the recept file to use if this condition matches.
.IR
.PP
Both
.I exe
and
.I comm
can contain the * character for wildcard matching.
.PP
The conditions are checked to find a match in the order specified. The
first match will cause the minicoredumper to use the recept for that
condition. If no conditions match, the minicoredumper will exit and
no
.BR core (5)
dump will be generated.
.PP
If
.I exe
and/or
.I comm
are not specified for a condition, they will use a default value "*".
.PP
If
.I recept
is not specified for a condition, the built-in minicoredumper defaults
are used.
.PP
.I exe
and
.I comm
have a "logical AND" relationship. A "logical OR" behavior can be
achieved by specifying one condition with only
.I exe
and another condition with only
.IR comm .
.
.SH NOTES
The exact path where data is dumped is logged to
.BR syslog (3).
.PP
If an 8th argument of
.BR minicoredumper (1)
is provided, the name and location of this file will depend on that value.
.
.SH EXAMPLES
Here is an example configuration file:
.PP
.nf
{
    "base_dir": "/tmp",
    "watch": [
        {
            "exe": "*/my_example_app",
            "recept": "/etc/minicoredumper/example.recept.json"
        },
        {
            "comm": "example_app"
            "recept": "/etc/minicoredumper/example.recept.json"
        },
        {
            "exe": "/bin/*"
        },
        {
            "recept": "/etc/minicoredumper/generic.recept.json"
        }
    ]
}
.fi
.PP
In this example, dumped data will be stored in a directory named:
.br
.RS
/tmp/<command_basename>.<timestamp>.<pid>
.RE
.PP
For example, if there is a symbolic link:
.PP
.RS
/usr/bin/example_app -> /opt/my_apps/bin/my_example_app
.RE
.PP
and the user runs "example_app" and it crashes, the newly created files
could be found here:
.br
.RS
/tmp/example_app.20151103.114054+0100.15143
.RE
.PP
The example above contains 4 conditions that will be checked in order.
.PP
The first condition will match if the binary "*/my_example_app" caused the
core dump. It will use the recept file:
.br
.RS
/etc/minicoredumper/example.recept.json
.RE
.PP
The second condition will match if the basename of the command is
"example_app". It will also use the recept file:
.br
.RS
/etc/minicoredumper/example.recept.json
.RE
.PP
The third condition will match for any binaries under "/bin/*". It will use
the built-in
.BR minicoredumper (1)
defaults.
.PP
The fourth condition will match everything. It will use the recept file:
.br
.RS
/etc/minicoredumper/generic.recept.json
.RE
.PP
In the example where the user runs "example_app", the first condition will
match since example_app is a symbolic link to /opt/my_apps/bin/my_example_app.
.PP
A minimal (yet still useful) configuration file could look like this:
.PP
.nf
{
    "base_dir": "/tmp",
    "watch": [
        {
            "exe": "*"
        }
    ]
}
.fi
